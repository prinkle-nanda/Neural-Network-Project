# Project Overview
This project was completed as part of my PGP in AI & ML from Great Learning. It focuses on building, training, and optimizing neural networks using TensorFlow and Keras. The objective is to classify signal data effectively while applying hyperparameter tuning for performance improvement.

# Key Objectives
  * Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
  * Pre-process data:
      - Handle missing values
      - Normalize features using MinMaxScaler
  * Implement Neural Networks:
     - Design a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model using TensorFlow/Keras
     - Apply dropout regularization to prevent overfitting
  * Optimize models with Keras Tuner for hyperparameter tuning.
  * Evaluate model performance using accuracy, loss curves, and confusion matrices.

# Tools & Libraries Used
  * Python (Jupyter Notebook)
  * TensorFlow & Keras (Deep Learning Frameworks)
  * Keras Tuner (Hyperparameter Optimization)
  * Pandas, NumPy (Data Manipulation)
  * Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)
  * Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV)
  * Scikit-Learn (Data Preprocessing & Model Evaluation)
